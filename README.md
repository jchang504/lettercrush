# Lettercrush

Lettercrush is a web-based AI assistant for the game
[Letterpress](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424)
. A mostly-finished version is hosted
[here](http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~jemminc/lettercrush/). You can use it
to destroy your friends in Letterpress or hone your own skills by playing as
the "opponent" and always choosing the first choice move for the AI. It saves
your games automatically after each move in [HTML5 local
storage](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp).

## About

Lettercrush was designed and written solely by Jemmin Chang (jchang504) during
summer 2014 while learning JavaScript and other web technologies. It is based
on, but largely improved from, an earlier version written in Java for a high
school senior project. More info is available on
[http://jemm.in](http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~jemminc/).

Lettercrush is not being actively maintained or developed. There are a few
known small logical and UI bugs that may someday be fixed, but it is suitable
for everyday Letterpress assistant (some prefer the term "cheating") purposes.

## AI

This section will soon be filled with detailed information about how
Lettercrush's AI works.
