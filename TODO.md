TODO List

- Some kind of checking for played words: warn for invalid? But still allow? Then block or not block prefixes of words not in dictionary? (Currently doesn't block any prefixes if main word isn't in TST)
- Update score underneath board when move is selected (choose-move)
- CRITICAL: Board updating after selecting opponent's move doesn't work sometimes. Board remains outdated (by a turn?) and moves produced are based on previous position, it seems.
- Add styling
